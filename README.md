# GEMU
A multi-emulator for Garry's Mod

GEMU is a 6-in-1 emulator addon in GMod.  This addon uses the [Nesbox Flash-based emulator](https://github.com/nesbox/emulator) to emulate almost all NES, SNES, GB, GBC, GBA, and Sega Genesis games.

**How to get started:**
- GEMU requires you to install the [Adobe Flash NPAPI plugin](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/)
- Download GEMU from the Garry's Mod workshop [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=945777403 "here")
- Start up Garry's Mod
- Navigate to Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\gemu\roms and place your rom files here.  Accepted filetypes are: .nes .smc .sfc .gb .gbc. gba .md .gen
- Head back to the game, browse for your ROM and enjoy playing retro games straight in GMod!
